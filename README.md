# Deep-Learning-to-study-global-human-migration-based-on-Satellite-imagery-and-social-information

The decision-making process behind human migration is complex and influenced by various factors such as economic opportunities, environmental conditions, conflicts, and social dynamics. These factors are represented in diverse data sources, spanning from traditional household surveys to modern satellite imagery and even social media and news reports. 

This study introduces a novel deep learning-based approach to fuse data from satellite imagery and census records, aiming to estimate migratory patterns from Mexico to the United States. 

The methodology follows a three-stage process: 
1. A matrix-based representation of socioeconomic factors is constructed for each municipality in Mexico.
2. A convolutional neural network is deployed, integrating both satellite imagery and the constructed socioeconomic matrix.
3. Finally, the output vectors from this model are utilized to estimate migratory flows. The research findings indicate that this approach surpasses alternative methods by around 10% in terms of accuracy (r2), suggesting that leveraging multi-modal data fusion offers a promising avenue for modeling migratory dynamics.

This innovative technique showcases the potential of integrating diverse datasets and advanced machine learning algorithms to gain deeper insights into complex socio-economic phenomena like human migration.
